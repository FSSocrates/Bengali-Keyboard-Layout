# Shuvro Fixed Layout

This is a fixed keyboard layout of **Bengali** language in Unicode.

Its key mapping is *almost similar* to Phonetic pattern but typing method is fully Fixed.

This layout design is aimed to those people who are comfortable with the 'Phonetic' method and want a easier 'Fixed' alternative. And mostly those who find it difficult to memorize Fixed layouts, like Bijoy.

Due to some principle differences, Fixed layouts requires a bit 'sacrifice' to match up with Phonetic layout experiences. For example, ট-বর্গ and ত-বর্গ both requires 'T' to represent. And same goes for 'D'. 'S' represents 3 শ (শ, স, ষ). And so on...

I tried the best combination possible to combine the essence of Phonetic and the usability of Fixed layout.
